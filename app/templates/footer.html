    <h2 class="text-orange-100 font-bold">ABOUT THE APP</h2>

    <p class="desc text-orange-100 font-regular">
      This app uses advanced machine learning models to predict theft crime in
      Chicago.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="desc text-orange-100 font-regular">
      <strong>Neighborhood Component Feature Selection (NCFS)</strong><br />
      NCFS is a method that selects the most important factors affecting crime,
      like population and poverty rates. It filters out less useful information,
      helping the model focus on what matters most for accurate predictions.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p class="desc text-orange-100 font-regular">
      <strong>Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)</strong><br />
      GBDT takes the selected factors from NCFS and builds a series of decision
      trees to predict theft crime. This application improves accuracy by adding
      methods to handle complex data and make better forecasts.
